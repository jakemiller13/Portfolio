# Portfolio

This is a collection of projects which I am either particularly proud of, or that I feel showcase particular skillsets. I will give a brief description of each of the projects below and why I have specifically chosen them.

### Analyzing_Video_Game_Sales
This was a project which analyzed video game sales from 1980-2016. The idea of the project was to understand what the best-selling video game genres and consoles were in the major international game markets (North America, Europe, Japan). Using that information, video game development companies could theoretically target specific genres and consoles to the top-selling regions. I also created several visualizations which I think helped boil down a lot of information into very presentable formats to help drive decision making.

### Udacity-AI_Programming_With_Python-Final_Project
This is the first image classifier I ever created. It uses Pytorch and the VGG19 pretrained convolutional neural network to classify images of flowers.

### DL0320EN-Final_Project
This is another image classifier project, this time classifying images of Euros using the Keras library. I compare the accuracy of the ResNet50 network to the VGG16 network. VGG16 performs significantly better for this use case.
