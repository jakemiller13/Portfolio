# Portfolio

This is a collection of projects which I am either particularly proud of, or that I feel showcase particular skillsets. I will give a brief description of each of the projects below and why I have specifically chosen them.

For 2020, my goal is to complete one new project every month. Each project will use a new concept, technology, language, etc.

### January: Food Desert Investigation
I use a logistic regression model to gain an understanding of which demographics are most affected by food deserts.

### February: Optimizing Boston Blue Bikes Infrastructure
Looking at the busiest stations and routes, I look at how Blue Bike stations could be optimized around the city by adding or removing bike docks.

### March: 2020 Wellness Survey
As head of the Wellness Committee at my company, we send out 1-2 surveys per year soliciting feedback on the services we provide. In this project, I use natural language processing on the text responses to learn how we can improve as a committee.

## Previous Projects

### Query_Script
This is a Bash script I wrote for the midterm project in Intro to Data Science Management in my RIT Master's program. I am particularly proud of this project because I had no familiarity with Bash prior to this project. I taught myself in a couple of weeks and received a perfect score on the project.

### Tracking_Activity_and_Sleep_Using_My_Fitbit
This is a personal project in which I looked at how my daily activity output affected my sleep over the course of a month-long step challenge. After the completion of this project, I also presented it as a lightning talk at the local Boston Python Meetup group.

### Boston_Food_Establishment_Inspections
This is a personal project where I take a close look at the violations that were issued to Boston food establishments and see what impact issuing a violation has on how the restaurants operate afterwards. As someone who enjoys going out to eat around the city, this was a fun and eye-opening examination.

### Boston_Airbnb_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Keras
This is a personal project in which I used natural language processing to classify reviews of Boston Airbnb's. I first use Keras to train a recurrent neural network on a corpus of labeled movie reviews from IMDB, and then use that model to analyze sentiment on the Airbnb reviews. 

### Analyzing_Video_Game_Sales
This was a final project in the "Python for Data Science" UCSD course on edX.org, in which I analyzed video game sales from 1980-2016. The idea of the project was to understand what the best-selling video game genres and consoles were in the major international game markets (North America, Europe, Japan). Using that information, video game development companies could theoretically target specific genres and consoles to the top-selling regions. I also created several visualizations which I think helped boil down a lot of information into very presentable formats to help drive decision making.

### DL0320EN-Final_Project
This was another image classifier project, this time classifying images of Euros using Keras. It was the capstone project for the IBM Deep Learning Professional Certificate on edX.org. In this project I compare the accuracy of the ResNet50 network to the VGG16 network. VGG16 performs significantly better for this use case.

### Udacity-AI_Programming_With_Python-Final_Project
This was the final project for the Udacity course "AI Programming with Python" and was the first image classifier I ever created. It uses Pytorch and the VGG19 pretrained convolutional neural network to classify images of flowers.
