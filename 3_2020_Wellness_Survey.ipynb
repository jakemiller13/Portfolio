    "As head of the Wellness Committee at my company, we are responsible for hosting weekly fitness classes, company-wide step challenges, maintaining the on-site gym, etc. Our goal is to provide our employees with as many wellness-related resources as possible, both physical and mental. To make sure we are providing the activities and resources that employees want, we send out an anonymous survey 1-2 times per year asking for feedback on our offerings.\n",

    "The following 10 question survey was sent out at the beginning of 2020, asking for feedback on our 2019 offerings. In 2019, we offered 3 fitness classes per week (yoga, Pilates, bootcamp) and 2 step challenges, as well as several gym upgrades. 5 survey questions asked for simple rating responses while 5 were open-text responses. The questions were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On a scale of 1 through 5, please rate how much you enjoy the Step Challenges. If you do not participate please select N/A.\n",
    "2. What can we do to improve the Step Challenges?\n",
    "3. How satisfied are you with the Fit Lab classes? Please select N/A if you do not attend.\n",
    "4. What could we do to improve the Fit Lab classes here?\n",
    "5. How satisfied are you with the Pilates classes? Please select N/A if you do not attend.\n",

One of the larger, on-going challenges we will always face as a committee is trying to improve attendance at classes and participation in step challenges.
